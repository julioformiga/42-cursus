dup2(2)
dup2(2) helps you ‘replace’ open file descriptors. By default, FD 0, 1 and 2 are open and are set to stdin, stdout and stderr respectively. dup2(2) allows you to replace these with another FD, which you may obtain with open(2). This can be useful for redirecting output from one FD to another, like using printf(3) to print to a file instead of the terminal.

Here is an example of using dup2(2) to redirect the output of a process from the terminal to a file:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main()
{
	int fd;

	fd = open("example.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0644);
	dup2(fd, STDOUT_FILENO);
	close(fd);
	printf("This is printed in example.txt!\n");

	return (0);
}
